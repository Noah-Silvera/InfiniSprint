problem - need to 'sync' events from the calender with my app - but also need to preserve app data
	use the google calender for each event
	
	
On a fetch
	check if UIID is present in saved rank data
		if not, add event to saved rank data and assign it a rank - add to bottom in order of returned results
		if yes, check if the relevant meta-data has updated
			if yes, change the data for the saved event
	load the events from the saved rank data into the app ( pass these events )
	



	CASES
	on a drag operation within a list
		send a metadata update request to the server - update the rank
		SERVER SIDE - check if the request is updating a google calender property or a app property
			if google cal - update both local and network data
			if not just local data
		send the changed data back to the client
			
	on a drag from backlog to sprint
		send a metadata update request to the server - update the rank, update the date of the event to the current day, update the list the event is in
		SERVER SIDE - check if the request is updating a google calender property or a app property
			if google cal - update both local and network data
			if not just local data
		send the changed data back to the client
		
	on a drag from sprint to backlog
		send a metadata update request to the server - update the rank, update the date of the event to tommorow, update the list the event is in
		SERVER SIDE - check if the request is updating a google calender property or a app property
			if google cal - update both local and network data
			if not just local data
		send the changed data back to the client
		
	on a drag to a trashcan
		send a metadat update request to the server - delete the event off google cal and local data
		send the changed data back to the client
		
	on a changing of description or summary - send a metadata request to server
	send changed data back to client
