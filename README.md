# InfiniSprint

Takes your google calendar all day events and allows you to make a mini sprint, with a backlog, done collumn, and sprint countdown

## Purpose

Other people have created similiar apps, and done it better. This app was started as a learning experience. I wanted to a.) Get experience working on a long and complex piece of software, b.) Learn the challenges of integrating and synchronizing with an external data source ( in this case, google calendar ), and c.) Learn about the architectural patterns that work, and the patterns that don't, and find out more about how to program well at every step.

I'm recording the challenges I've encountered and what I've learned in the wiki. 

I plan on keeping this project privately hosted for myself. Star the repo if you'd use it if it went public!
